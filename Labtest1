<h4>PERSONALITY:</h4>
Ragdoll cats are known to be gentle, calm and sociable. Affectionate without being demanding, Ragdolls have an almost dog-like devotion to their owners. 
Some people also say they are attuned to emotional needs, a characteristic that makes them a perfect companion animal.
<h4>LIVING WITH:</h4>
If your schedule demands absence for hours during the day, Ragdoll may not be the right cat breed for you. Looking after your Ragdoll should be high on y
our priority list, so you shouldn't leave them alone for more than eight hours.

<h4>PERSONALITY:</h4>
The Scottish Fold is a breed of domestic cat with a natural dominant gene mutation that affects cartilage throughout the body, causing the ears to "fold", bending forward 
and down towards the front of the head, which gives the cat what is often described as an "owl-like" appearance.
<h4>LIVING WITH:</h4>
Scottish Folds make great house pets and are very affectionate, smart, and talkative. They thrive as indoor pets and get along well with kids and other animalsâ€”but they 
don't mind being the only pet in the house either and will accept all the pampering you can give them.</td>

<h4>PERSONALITY:</h4>
The typical Birman cat personality is affectionate, friendly, gentle, and curious. Because they have such an easy-going and kind demeanor, these 
cats are a wonderful choice for families with children or households with other cats or dogs.
<h4>LIVING WITH:</h4>
Also known as the sacred cat of Burma, Birmans are a popular breed of domestic cat known for their friendly disposition and clear blue eyes. Believed to have originated 
in Burma, the Birman cats are considered sacred cats of the Kittah priests.
